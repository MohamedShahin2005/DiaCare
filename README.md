## 🧩 Design Patterns Implemented

- **Repository Pattern (Generic)** → abstracts data access  
- **Unit of Work** → coordinates multiple repositories  
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** → decouples layers & manages lifetimes  
- **Facade Pattern** → Service layer (AuthService, ProfileService) provides simple interface to controllers  
- **DTO Pattern** → RegisterDto, UserProfileDto, PredictionInputDto  
- **Adapter Pattern** → planned for AI model integration  
- **Singleton** → Configuration (JWT settings), caching services
